Function for generating pallets done.
class for locations and methods for loading and unloading.
next to do:
- before loading pallets onto location, create user input for asking which locations we want to load first,
 then ask how many pallets( create a TKinterface with buttons )
✔️ Create a pallet class
✔️ First thing is to generate pallets and store them, then load them(not generate and load them at the same time)
✔️ Add check for not loading more pallets than was generated
✔️ if i am generating 50 pallets but want to load only 40, i need a simple way of retrieving which pallets are loaded,
and which are in the not-loaded state(lets call it void)
✔️ create a function for creating the log file(excel) storing data inside(IDs, datetime) and then creating another
 function for retrieving those information for loading
- we want to generate, and then create a limit check for not adding more than the location limit is.
- before unloading pallets from location to a different location, first create user input to ask from which location
we want to unload and ask how many pallets to unload(or create function based on the pallet id to unload), and when
the location is empty, add a warning that location is empty.
- create simple interface from TK interface with buttons, latter create visual representation of pallets, locations,
reach trucks, EPTs in pygame or any other visual module
- create a simple log with dates, times, and pallet ID (probably excel file for later data analysis)
- create actual functionality for saving the IDs to the locations(not just repeat the same thing without saving)


# Mark when something is done ✔️
